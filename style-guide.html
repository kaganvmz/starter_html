      displayed.</p>

      within letters pairs (kerning).</p>
    <h3>Heading Three Looks Like This</h3>

    <h3>Drop Cap</h3>
    <p>
      <span class="dropcap">A</span> drop cap is the first character of a document or paper that is the largest letter of that page and takes up
      several lines or sentences of the first paragraph. Below is a basic example of a drop cap.&nbsp;Drop caps should be sparingly
      used. It is best used just once where the text starts. The attractiveness of drop caps is such that even a single use
      calls out attention to the text that follows. A bit of care with that first letter and you may just find readability
      improving.</p>
    <p>To add a drop cap, simply wrap the first letter with a span with a
      <em>drop cap&nbsp;</em>class</p>
    <pre>&lt;span class="dropcap"&gt;C&lt;/span&gt;offee...</pre>
    <h3>Highlight</h3>
    <p>There are many cases when you need to
      <span class="highlight">draw userâ€™s attention</span> to a specific part of the sentence. Highlighting the text may be the answer. Simply wrap
      the words you need to be highlighted with the &nbsp;highlight
      <em>&nbsp;</em>class:</p>
    <pre>&lt;span class="highlight"&gt;Highlighted text&lt;/span&gt;</pre>
    <h3>Blockquotes</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Sir Winston Leonard Spencer-Churchill</strong> was a British statesman who was the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom
      from 1940 to 1945 and again from 1951 to 1955. Churchill was also an officer in the British Army, a historian, a writer
      and an artist. He won the Nobel Prize in Literature, and was the first person to be made an honorary citizen of the United
      States.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p style="text-align: center;">Success is not final, failure is not fatal, it is the courage to continue that counts.
        <br>
        <cite>Winston Churchill</cite>
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Churchill was born into the family of the Dukes of Marlborough, a branch of the Spencer family. His father, Lord Randolph
      Churchill, was a charismatic politician who served as Chancellor of the Exchequer; his mother, Jennie Jerome, was an
      American socialite. As a young army officer, he saw action in British India, the Sudan, and the Second Boer War. He gained
      fame as a war correspondent.</p>
